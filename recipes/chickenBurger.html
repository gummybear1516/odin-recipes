    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The chicken for this spicy chicken burger with beer cheese sauce is
      marinated in beer and spices for 4 hours, then grilled. Thereâ€™s more beer
      in the quick stovetop cheese sauce that is poured over the top. Don't
      forget to grill the buns and add your favorite chicken burger toppings!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup light beer</li>
      <li>1 tablespoons smoked paprika</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
      <li>2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breast halves</li>
      <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pour beer, paprika, chili powder, red pepper flakes, and garlic cloves
        into a resealable plastic bag. Add chicken, coat with the marinade,
        squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator,
        at least 4 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook chicken on the prepared grill until no longer pink and juices run
        clear, 10 to 15 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted
        into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, make cheese sauce. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium
        heat. Whisk in flour; whisk continuously until mixture turns golden and
        forms a smooth paste. Pour in half and half and beer; stir until mixture
        thickens, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in cheese until melted, 2 to 3 minutes
        more. Stir in paprika, garlic powder, and ground mustard.
      </li>
      <li>
        Toast hamburger buns on the grill until they show grill marks, about 2
        minutes. Add your favorite toppings, pour cheese sauce on top, and serve
        immediately.
